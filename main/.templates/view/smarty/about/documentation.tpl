		<p>
			A lot of use-cases and other practical examples are covered on this site already and more will be added most likely. In fact, this site itself uses Qoopido Glue which makes it part of the documentation as well. But if you are interested in a full API documentation Qoopido Glue comes with configuration files for Doxygen. Simply install the cross-platform Doxygen application, open the configuration file and build the documentation directly from the sources.
