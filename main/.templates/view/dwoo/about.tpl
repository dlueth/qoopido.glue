			<h6>Complete microframework for PHP 5.3+</h6>
			<h1>Qoopido Glue</h1>
		</hgroup>

		<p>
			Having used a wide variety of PHP frameworks over the last ten years and never being really satisfied with any of them I decided to develop my own framework a couple of years ago. I started from scratch a couple of times during development, due to the very complex nature of such a task. Finally I have reached a point where I think the framework is not only a proof of concept but can be released as beta to polish it up a bit with public feedback. All of the core and components should be robust and I am almost sure their API will not change to an extent to become completely incompatible in the future.

			Keep in mind that Qoopido Glue is a feature-rich, light and fast microframework which main aim is rapid paired with modular development. It was never planned as and will never be a replacement for enterprise aimed frameworks like ZF for example.
