			At the heart of Qoopido Glue there are several classes building the very core of the framework. This is mainly the Core class itself which reflects the bootstrap process and the rest of the process flow. In addition a factory class is part of the core as well as Qoopido Glue's Event-dispatcher system which is used consistently throughout the framework.

		<p>
			Beside the core itself the rest of the core classes are initialized prior to any other optional or non optional part of the framework.
